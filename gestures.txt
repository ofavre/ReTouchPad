Pay attention to progressive appearance of fingers!


Finger count detection:
  [nothing],[short],get_the_count
  look at the confidence of the path of any gesture in recognition
Click detection (possibly of a few fingers among all present ones):
  down[x],[short],up[same:x]
Move detection:
  Some direction
    using the barycenter of some fingers
  Pinch
    using distance of a pair of some fingers
  Ignored
    small move in confusing situations
  Normal
    big, allowed move
Role detection:
  According to the recognized moves of some fingers


Each gesture:
 - listens to pre-synthetized events
 - follows a state machine with probabilities
 - calculates its confidence, and its completeness status
 - posts actions to be taken with the current confidence
 - declares precedence and anihilation
The system:
 - pre-synthetizes events
 - decide the max delay of posted actions (before they'll have to be taken)
 - decide to invalidate past actions
 - takes immediate actions if no alternative is comming / if all alternatives have gone
 - takes deferred actions if max delay has been met
